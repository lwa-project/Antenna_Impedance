1.  The final assembly of this build consists of a set of two boards; one flipped and rotated facing the other and bolted together.
2.  The screws used to assemble the two boards are #6-32 pan head screws paird with corresonding nylon locking nuts. 
3.  These boards are identical with the exception of the orientation of the SMA (connector S3).
4.  On one of the boards, the connector designated S3 is installed on the bottom of the PCB (facing down). S3 is installed facing up on the second board in the assembly. 
5.  A photograph of an earlier version of the finished assmebly is included in this directory to show connector orientation and assembly method.
6.  Please call 703-203-1302 for clarification before starting work.
7.  Hole locations are indicated in separate .drl file, included with the gerber package. That file takes precedence over this drawing.
8.  Board outline indicated in separate Edge.Cuts file, included with the gerber package. That file takes precedence over this drawing.
