The FEE S-parameter measurements were completed in a few different phases.
First, in October 2022, 2-port measurements were made using the original FEE
Test Fixture which ran the signal from the VNA through a HX62A hyrbid coupler 
in reverse in order to convert from an unbalanced signal to a balanced signal 
which could be injected into a FEE board.

Later, it was decided that the Calibration Fixtures could be used here in order
to make measurements which de-embedded the HX62A coupler. However, in the interest
of saving time and lots of effort, the updated measurements were only done for S11
in January of 2023.

In order to effectibely de-embed the HX62A from the S12 and S21 measurments, the 
insertion loss for the HX62A was measured.

A complete set of S-parameters for the FEE board consists of the newly measured S11,
the originally measured S12 and S21 corrected for the HX62A insertion loss, and the 
orginally measured S22.

In this directory, the original October 2022 2-port measurements are stored in S2P/ and 
the updated S11 measurements which de-embed the HX62A are stored in S1P/

Various documentation about the measurements is also provided for extra context and clarity.
