Test Fixtures
=============

Description
-----------
This directory contains the KiCAD v7 project files needed to build the test
fixtures used in [DiLullo et al. (2023, PASP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14904).
There are two sub-directories: "LWA Active Test Fixture 2022" and "LWA Cal Test
Fixture 2022".  "Active" contains the board that was used to make the impedance
measurements.  "Cal" contains the base board for making the open,
short, and load calibration fixtures for the measurements.

Within each sub-directory is the full KiCAD v7 project, the Gerber files, and BoM
for the board, relevant data sheets for the parts used, and an image of the
rendered 3D model of the full board.
